# This file configures the New Relic Agent.  New Relic monitors

# This section is for settings common to all environments.

common: &default_settings

  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account. For example, if your license key is 12345 use this:
  # license_key: '12345'
  # The key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic service.
  # license_key: 'your license key'

  # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
  # If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application.
  # Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications)
  # to this application. To report data to more than one application
  # (useful for rollup reporting), separate the application names with ";".
  # For example, to report data to "My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2
  # This setting is required. Up to 3 different application names can be specified.
  # The first application name must be unique.
  # app_name: My Application

  # Set to true to enable support for auto app naming.
  # The name of each web app is detected automatically
  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for
  # web apps in New Relic.
  # Default is false.
  enable_auto_app_naming: true

  # Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming.
  # Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction.
  # Default is true.
  enable_auto_transaction_naming: true

  # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging
  # separate from that of your application.  Specify the log level here.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are:
  #   off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest
  # Default is info.
  log_level: info

  # The name of the log file.
  # Default is newrelic_agent.log.
  log_file_name: newrelic-apm.log

  # The log file path.
  # Default same directory as newrelic.jar
  log_file_path: /var/log

  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:

    # By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to
    # inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Not all rendering engines are supported.
    # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/real-user-monitoring-in-java#manual_instrumentation
    # for instructions to add these manually to your pages.
    # Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.
    auto_instrument: false

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the New Relic service once a
  # minute. Included in the transaction is the exact call sequence of
  # the transactions including any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # New Relic. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for the "Frustrated" Apdex level
    # (greater than four times the apdex_t value).
    # Default is apdex_f.
    transaction_threshold: 5.0

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals.
    # Default is obfuscated.
    record_sql: off

    # Determines whether the agent will capture query plans for slow
    # SQL queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
    # Default is true.
    explain_enabled: false

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and
  # sends them to New Relic for viewing.
  error_collector:

    # Use this property to exclude specific http status codes from being reported as errors
    # by providing a comma separated list of status codes.
    # The default is to exclude 404s. If you want to override
    # this, you must provide any new value as an empty list is ignored.
    ignore_status_codes: 400,401,403,404,409,410,412,423,429

  # Cross Application Tracing adds request and response headers to
  # external calls using supported HTTP libraries to provide better
  # performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents.
  cross_application_tracer:

    # Set to false to disable cross application tracing.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: false
